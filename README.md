# acme-certificates

A repository with sample TLS certificates in the format that are typically used by Certificate Authorities (PEM, PKCS7, PKCS12)

This repository provides a sample server certificate signed by a sample CA with two intermediary CAs in a fictional Acme corporation.

The certificate hierarchy is following:

- `CN=Acme Root CA`
  - `CN=Acme Internal CA`
    - `CN=Acme Signing CA`
      - `CN=Server`

The purpose is to provide data for testing of server certificate import with different input formats.

All the certificates are generated by the [`acme_cert.sh`](acme_cert.sh) script. It requires Java 8 and openssl to be installed.

There are following files:

1. [`server.pem`](out/server.pem) - a signed server certificate in the PEM format without the chain and without private key
2. [`server_full_chain.pem`](out/server_full_chain.pem) - a signed server certificate with the full the chain in PEM format and without private key
3. [`server_full_chain.pem`](out/server_full_chain_private_key.pem) - a signed server certificate with the full the chain and with private key in PEM format

**Note:** [KeyStore Explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org/) is a useful tool for examining certificates and working with keystores.
